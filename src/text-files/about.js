			<strong>LONDON STOP & SEARCH</strong> is an interactive map that plots all police stop & searches that occurred in 2019. 						
		</p>
		<p className="mt-2">
			In the UK, police officers have the power to conduct stop & searches if they have "reasonable grounds" to suspect that
			an offence has been committed. To read about your rights in these situations visit this <a className="text-yellow-500 hover:text-yellow-600" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/advice_information/stop-and-search/">page</a>.

			Turn on/off the choropleth map and stop & search location points from the panel to the right.   
			Additionally, stop & searches can be filtered according to several variables including the ethnicity, age range, and gender of the people questioned.
